# Peer Review Response

This document outlines how our team addressed the feedback we received during the peer review process.

## Feedback 1: Improve `test-create_histogram_grid.R`

> "Tests in `test-create_histogram_grid.R` are limited and only valid inputs are used."

**Our Response:**
We revised `test-create_histogram_grid.R` to:
- Move test data out of `test_that()` blocks
- Add tests for invalid input (e.g., non-dataframe input, missing columns)

Location: `test/testthat/test-create_histogram_grid.R`

## Feedback 2: Missing examples in helper functions

> "Examples in functions not provided."

**Our Response:**
We added `@examples` blocks and Roxygen2-style documentation for all functions in the `R/` and `R/validate_helpers.R` scripts.

Location: All scripts under `R/`

## Feedback 3: Unclear script purpose and pipeline order

> "It would help to label which script corresponds to which step."

**Our Response:**
We revised the `README.md` to include:
- A structured table describing each script's purpose
- A recommended order of execution
- Expected output files

Location: `README.md`
