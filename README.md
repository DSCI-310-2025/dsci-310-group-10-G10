## Overview

This project aims to investigate the factors that influence Airbnb pricing by analyzing a dataset of listings from Berlin, London, and Paris. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression, we seek to identify the key predictors of Airbnb pricing.

The data we used was collected from <https://zenodo.org/records/4446043#.Y9Y9ENJBwUE>.
